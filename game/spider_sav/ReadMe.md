## spider.sav

A save game for Spider solitaire for Windows XP.

Source: just opened the software and saved the game.

[`deck.txt`](./deck.txt) contains the layout of the deck as seen on the screen (assumming they all are visible). In fact that file was generated by a python script (embedded into `spider_sav.ksy`) from the save and then verified that it matches what is seen on the screen.
